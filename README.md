ocropusGTEdit
=============
This software offers a quick and yet dirty way to access both text and image ground truth files for the ocropus/ocropy OCR framework.
It aims to replace the hocr-edit addon solution for the firefox browser which is no longer maintained and partly infunctional.

The current version 0.1 is to be used only with caution.

-(+) automated matching of image and text files on directory choice
-(+) accelerated text editing workflow by keyboard use
-(+) autosave
-(-) automated scaling of image and text input from files according to window size (currently fixed to 50 px/36 pt height)
